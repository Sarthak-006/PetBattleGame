## Overview
Welcome to **Pet Battle Game**, a decentralized application that merges the excitement of pet battles with the power of blockchain technology! Built on the Ethereum network using **Web3.js** and **Solidity**, this game allows players to create, battle, and manage their unique pets in a secure and transparent environment. 

### Inco Network Challenge
We are thrilled to participate in the **Inco Network** hackathon, leveraging cutting-edge **FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)** technology to deploy confidential smart contracts with our **fhEVM (FHE + EVM)**. Our goal is to create a unique application that not only entertains but also addresses real-world challenges in confidentiality and security.

## Key Features
- **Create Your Pet**: Players can create their own pets with unique names and stats using the `createPet` function.
- **Engage in Battles**: Challenge other players by battling their pets using the `battle` function. The outcome is determined by your pet's stats, making strategy essential!
- **View Stats**: Keep track of your pet's performance and your overall player stats, including wins and losses, through the `getPetStats` and `getPlayerStats` functions.
- **Blockchain Security**: All transactions and pet data are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.js
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing

## Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the Pet Battle Game [here](https://sarthak-006.github.io/PetBattleGame/).

## How It Works
1. **Create a Pet**: Use the `createPet(name)` function to create a new pet. Each pet has unique stats that influence battle outcomes.
2. **Battle**: Use the `battle(opponentAddress)` function to challenge another playerâ€™s pet.
3. **Fetch Stats**: Use `getPetStats()` to retrieve your pet's stats and `getPlayerStats(account)` to view your overall performance.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthak-006/PetBattleGame.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pet-battle-game
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start battling!

## UI/UX Design
The application features a clean and user-friendly interface, designed to enhance user experience. For bonus points, we have incorporated brand colors and design elements that align with the theme of confidential blockchain.

## Use Cases
This project addresses several use cases, including:
- **Confidential Gaming**: Players can engage in battles without exposing sensitive data.
- **Identity Solutions**: Players maintain ownership of their pets securely on the blockchain.
